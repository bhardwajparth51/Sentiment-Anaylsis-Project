ðŸ“– Project Description

This project performs Sentiment Analysis on the IMDB 50K Movie Reviews Dataset, a benchmark dataset containing 50,000 reviews equally divided into positive and negative sentiments. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can automatically classify whether a given movie review expresses a positive or negative opinion.

The project includes:

Dataset: IMDB Movie Reviews (50,000 labeled reviews).

Preprocessing: Cleaning text (removing HTML tags, stopwords, punctuation, and special characters), tokenization, and vectorization (Bag of Words / TF-IDF).

Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM to classify reviews.

Evaluation: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure model effectiveness.

Visualization: Charts to show sentiment distribution and confusion matrix for model analysis.
